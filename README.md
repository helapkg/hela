## Background

What is that? It is a package that is useful for automation and keeping things on one place.

It is meant to be used in `npm scripts`, but if you decide to use it as standalone tool
you still can. The core is pretty minimal, in [really 80 lines](./src/index.js) without the documentation comments, but it has very flexible nature by embracing Shareable Configs.
Yes, it supports presets of tasks same as found in ESLint and Renovate. Each preset
is just an object with `extends` and/or `tasks` properties. 

A working preset, you can see in use here (yes, `hela` uses itself and presets to release itself) and
in the first created preset [hela-preset-tunnckocore][], which by the way uses itself **AND** `hela` too! It is pretty awesome, seriously.

Not only the presets gives us power. Hela uses pretty fantastic configuration loader, which is separated from the core as [pretty-config](https://github.com/tunnckoCore/pretty-config). It is similar to the very much used [cosmiconfig][], but is a lot more smaller (by implementation, by lines and by deps means) with great defaults and lookup on few places.

The `pretty-config`'s resolving mechanism looks for this files to load configuration (where
the `%s` is the name of the tool):

```js
const configFiles = [
  '.%src.json', // 1
  '.%src.yaml', // 2
  '.%src.yml', // 3
  '.%src.js', // 4
  '%s.config.js', // 5
  '.%s.config.js', // 6
  '.%src', // 7 - first tries JSON, if fail to parse then fallback to YAML
  'package.json', // 8 - foo, fooConfig or pkg.config.foo fields
]
```

For example, to load some preset, you can create `.helarc.json` with this,
where if you skip `hela-preset-` prefix it is assumed automatically.

```json
{
  "extends": [
    "foo",
    "hela-preset-bar",
    "tunnckocore",
    "./some/relative/JS-or-JSON-file.js"]
}
```

And so, above will resolve `hela-preset-foo`, `hela-preset-bar`, `hela-preset-tunnckocore` and
the tasks/presets from some given relative file. And everything is recursive.

Basically, `hela` just loops over an object of key/value pairs, where key is the name of a task and the value is a `string` (directly passed to `execa`), an `array` of strings (run in series passed to [execa][]) or a `function`.

If task is a function, then it is passed with `({ parse, argv, taskName, hela, exec, shell, ...options })` signature. Worth mentioning that it is called in a `promise.then()` and so the nextTick - be aware of that.

## CLI
Install it as dev dependency of your project first, then you can use it just like
you use `gulp`, for example `hela <taskName>`. 
With [hela-config-tunnckocore][] preset you can run tasks like the following, but go there for more deep docs.

```
$ hela style
$ hela lint
$ hela format
$ hela commit
$ hela release
```

To start using some existing preset in your project add `.helarc` file in the root and set `extends` property to the name of the config (`hela-config-` prefix is assumed), for example:

```yaml
extends: tunnckocore
```

You also can override the tasks from the given preset, for example

```yaml
extends: tunnckocore
tasks:
  lint: echo foobar
```

And when running `hela lint` or `yarn hela lint` it will execute `echo foobar` instead of
`eslint --fix`. Also note that you have access to the shell's environment variables.

Try to run `hela show-cwd` somewhere

```yaml
tasks:
  show-cwd: echo "Your working directory is $PWD"
```

Notice that you don't need any presets to work correctly.

## API
Review carefully the provided examples and the working [tests](./test).

### [.hela](src/index.js#L40)

> Controls, merges and resolves all tasks from config files
> and passed through `opts.tasks`.
>
> All `opts` are passed to [execa-pro][] and to [execa][],
> so you can pass `opts.stdio: 'inherit'` for example
> to output the result of each command in the console, useful for things like prompt inputs.
> Resolving works recursively and support ESLint style presets through
> the `opts.extends`. The `extends` property can be `string` (the name of the preset,
> prefixed with `hela-config-`),  a function (that is passed with `{ extends, tasks }` object)
> or an object containing another `extends` and/or `tasks` properties.
>
> Configuration is handled by [@tunnckocore/pretty-config](https://github.com/tunnckoCore/pretty-config)
> which is pretty similar to the [cosmiconfig][] package and so the config
> files lookup order is:
> - `.helarc.{json,yaml,yml,js}`
> - `hela.config.js`
> - `.hela.config.js`
> - `.helarc` - YAML or JSON syntax
> - `package.json` - one of `hela`, `helaConfig` or `config.hela` fields

**Params**

* `opts` **{Object}**: requires to have at least `tasks` ot `extends` properties    
* `returns` **{Promise}**: so you can use `async/await` mechanism  

### [.exec](src/index.js#L70)

> A mirror of [execa-pro][]'s `.exec` method, see its docs. This is also
included in the object that is passed to each task if the task is a function.

**Params**

* `cmds` **{string|Array}**: commands to call, if array of strings executes in series    
* `options` **{Object}**: optional, passed to [execa-pro][] and so to [execa][]    
* `returns` **{Promise}**: so you can use `async/await` mechanism  

### [.shell](src/index.js#L85)

> A mirror of [execa-pro][]'s `.shell` method, see its docs. This is also
included in the object that is passed to each task if the task is a function.

**Params**

* `cmds` **{string|Array}**: commands to call, if array of strings executes in series    
* `options` **{Object}**: optional, passed to [execa-pro][] and so to [execa][]    
* `returns` **{Promise}**: so you can use `async/await` mechanism
